# DnD 3.5 Combat Table Simulator
a combat table simulator for DnD (supposed to be for 3.5)

it supports below features:
* Die roller like "3d6" or complex ones including paranthesis like "3d6 + 5d100 - (4*(d20))"
* Map Editor, very basic, can put walls, doors and notes
* Character editor, can put characters with full detail, almost everything can be put here
* Combat Simulator screen, not fully automated, for table top games.

Treasure roller screen requires a treasure.xml file but due to copyright issues I deleted it. It shall probably crash at that screen.
